    I‚Äôm an AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.
    I completed a one-year research project on **AI-assisted design in nanophotonics**, where I used neural networks 
    and optimization algorithms (Differential Evolution) to solve an inverse design problem.
    Skilled in **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **model optimization**, I‚Äôm seeking a full-time role where I can 
    leverage AI to create impactful, data-driven solutions.
